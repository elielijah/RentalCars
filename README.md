# RentalCars

Here lies my solution for the rental cars technical test.

As discussed with Clayton I was unable to configure tomcat properly on my machine rendering me unable to complete part 2 of the test 
I tried a number of things to reslove this inlcuding following different tutorials, deleting and reinstalling tomcat and eclipse but
I was still unlable get Tomcat to work properly.

Thank you
